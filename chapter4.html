    <div class="line">
    "The King is busy right now. So take a rest in this room for now
    Duke Kane."
    </div>


    <div class="line">
    "Thank you Alfred."
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    "It's my pleasure. Between how are your daughters doing?"
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    "They're fine. They went to the city today, so they're having
    fun preparing for their birthday party."
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    "I see. But please sir, don't let them stay there for too long.
    I heard a dangerous criminal is lurking around the city at night.
    Though it's not confirmed yet, we're doing our best to investiagate that."
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    "What? Why no one informed me right away? I'am the general
    of the Royal Guards after all, it's the part of my job to
    protect this city."
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    "I'm sorry Duke Kane, but your job is to keep the palace safe and the Royal family safe, besides... It's an unconfirmed information, so we didn;t want to trouble you with that."
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    Kane looked angry and frastrated but didn't say anything.
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    One of the guards came inside the room.
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    "Advisor Alfred, the King wants to see Duke Kane." said the guard.
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    "Understood. Shall we go Duke Kane?"
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    "Yes."
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    The king Einar was waiting for Kane in his office.
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    “Your Majesty.” Kane bowed after he entered the room and saw the king sitting on a sofa.
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    “Kane, you’re here. Please, raise you head.”
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    “Yes, your Majesty.”
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    “I hope you and your daughters are healthy.”
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    “Yes your Majesty. Thank you for your kindnesses. I hope her Majesty queen Mira and your sons are healthy and safe too.”
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    “Thank you Kane. Your family serves us well. If only we had more people like you and with your abilities... that would be really great.”
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    “Yes your Majesty. My daughter is my pride. Her abilities are not that powerful yet, but I’ll make sure to raise her into a fine warrior. And swords she summons are pretty powerful now, she’s got a good potential.”
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    “I see... I’m counting on you Kane. That’s unfortunate that not every heir of a family with abilities inherits them. But I’m glad to hear that your daughter has a potential to be a great warrior. Also, what about your second daughter, what was her name? The one you adopted around 5 years ago? Does she have any magical powers?”
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    “Yes, I’ll make sure of it! Her name is Kaelia, she’s a good child. My daughter felt lonely, at first after her mother passed away, and that when I figured I had a daughter from one of my acquaintances in the past from a woman from foreign kingdom. Though I'm not proud of that, it turned out Kaelia makes a good influence on Lexie, and Kaelia is very protective of her. I could teach her how to use a sword, she might become a good soldier. She is a brave one, something tells me she's willing to give up her own life for Lexie.”
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    King thought about something for a while, and then said.
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    “Hmm... bravery.. or stupidity. She can try hard to stay alive, if she really wants to protect her sister. But that’s not for me to judge. Also Kaelia... what kind of name is that? I have never heard of such a name. Where’s that woman from, Kaelia's mother?”
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    “Ah, I don't really remember. I was lucky to encounter Kaelia not far from the city. Unfortunately she have lost her memories, she doesn’t remember anything about her past. Only her name...”
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    “Interesting...” king made a thinking face. “Also, I heard the Assassins are making their move again, though it’s not confirmed yet, but you better be on your guard.”
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    “Yes your Majesty, I’ll raise the security of the palace. Please be careful and try not to stay alone until we confirm it.”
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    “I’m counting on you, I can’t let what happened 5 years ago to happen again. You have to make sure that the palace is all secured this time.”
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    Kane fell down of his knees lowering his head “Understood your Majesty! I won’t let what happen back them happen again! I’ll be extra careful!” Kane had a serious face, though somehow it seemed that he had a smile of his face for a moment.
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    “Your Majesty! It’s almost time for the training. Do you wish to say your words for the newcomers?” Advisor Alfred bowed.
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    “Oh, is it? Alright. Let’s go Kane.”
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    “Yes your Majesty.” Kane bowed.
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    But before they left the room, Einar whispered something to Alfred. Then they walked out of the room and made their way to the special royal court that was meant for training newcomers. King stood on a platform in front of hundred of knights, behind him stood his advisor and Kane, and advisor got everyone attention with his loud voice.
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    “Newborn knights, his Majesty is about to speak! Attention here!”
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    Everyone looked at king Einar and bowed.
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    “Protectors of our kingdoms, peace keepers, fair knights, yet deadly to those who brake the rules and peace inside the kingdom. That’s who you will become. I expect you make a great service to the kingdom. Your mind will stay sharp, but your heart soft and kind to those in need. Raise your heads and let the new knights be born today.”
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    At the moment he finished his words, every last of the knights raised their heads and put their right hands on their hearts and shouted “Yes your Majesty!”
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    Advisor continued “Now, brake into teams of 20 and wait for the next command. Duke Kane Stewart general of the royal knights will attend the training himself, to make sure of its quality.”
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    Newcomers started braking into teams of 20, while Kane spoke to the advisor.
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    “Advisor Alfred, have you prepared the 5 knights that will train each team? We need at least 5 to make sure every last of newcomers are supervised in their training.”
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    “Yes Duke Kane.” He invited the best knights for that reason in front. “There they are. Each is a general of their own fleet. It's a nice opportunity for you to meet them, you never met them before, right? They’re all in your command.”
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    “Yes, thank you advisor. Now, let’s the training begin.”
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    He assigned every general to each team and went trough the training plan once more, just in case. Even thought advisor gave them the plan that Kane prepared before. Generals began the training and Kane supervised every newcomer himself going back and forth on the court. He corrected newcomers if needed, but generals made a good job, Kane was impressed.
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    Kane came to one of the generals with red hair.
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    "What's your name?"
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    "Duke Kane! My name is Ryu. I'm am a General of magical fleet. It was surprising that advisor Alfred invited us for this training today. But I'll make sure to share my knowledge to these newcomers to my best!"
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    "I see, well you're a capable warrior, I'm sure you'll do just fine. Thanks for coming though. You must be busy with your own fleet."
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    "No, that's fine. We're not at war right now, so my people don't need me that much right now."
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    "Hmm. What about the other generals? I know we have horse fleet, warrior fleet and some others. Are they all generals of those fleets?"
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    "Yes Duke Kane, you're right about that. The general with white hair, his name is Beido, he's a general of air fleet. The general with brunette hair, his name is Taiga, general of warrior fleet. The general with long dark blue hair, he's Kon, general of horse fleet. And the last general with blond hair, his name is Raito, he's a general of Royal spies."
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    "Alright, thank you for the explanation. We haven't had a chance to meet each other before, so I'm glad to finally meet you general Ryu."
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    "Pleasure is mine Duke Kane. I wanted to meet you for a while now, a general of Royal knights is the highest rank among all generals. It's a pleasure to finally meet you."
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    Few hours later the training finished and Kane was preparing to get back to the mansion. He had to visit their training few more times. Though his main duty is to keep control of royal knights at the palace, to ensure royal family’s safety, and he had to come there everyday sometimes staying there at night too.
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    Back to Stewart daughters.
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    They changed their outfits to indoor dresses, and minded their own businesses. Lexie all excited couldn’t wait for tomorrow for the dresses and accessories to arrive at the mansion. And Kaelia in the meantime hid her weapons in her secret place. It was hollow armor statue, she specially requested it to place in her room as a decoration on the first year living in this mansion, she said that it’s her guardian angel and she feels more safe having it around her. She was only 10 years old, adults wouldn’t question or try to reject such a ridiculous request from a kid, it’s a kid after all. But not Lia, she knew exactly why she needed it. She also ordered maids not to touch it, she said she will be cleaning it herself since it’s a gift from her father. Yeah, childish behavior, that’s what maids thought, but had to obey.
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    They had a late lunch together and then Lexie and Kaelia decided to go out to the forest to have some fresh air. They saddled their horses, knights accompanied them. When they got back, Duke arrived at the mansion. Girls saw him and went to greet him unsaddling their horses.
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    “Father, you’re back! How did the training go?” Exited Lexie said.
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    “Welcome home father” said Kaelia politely.
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    “Girls, you came to meet me. How nice of you! Training went well. All newcomers are very capable.”
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    “I’m glad.” Lexie closed her eyes and smiled. “Actually, we we’re walking in the woods, wanted to have some fresh air. And then we saw you coming home.”
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    “Oh, I see. But you better stay home. I heard from villagers today that they’re bandits who made a camp in the forest. I will sent knights to search for them tonight, but the forest is vast. But I’m sure our knights will do their best. So you better not to go outside, even with knights escort, I can’t risk it.”
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    ‘Oooh, that’s interesting! Should I investigate that, and put an end to that threat? I didn’t use my skills in a while now.’ Kaelia seemed a bit excited.
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    “Oh, father. That’s terrible. I hope knights will be able to find and chase them away!”
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    ‘Chase them away? Sister you’re too kind. Those miserable thieves deserve to die. Besides I can't let them harm you.’
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    “Yes, you don’t have to worry. Just stay inside the mansion. It’s about dinner time, why won’t we go inside?”
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    “Yes father, of course!” Said Lexie
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    “Yes.” Kaelia nodded.
    </div>

    <div class="line">
    They had dinner together. Talked about their visit to the city and discussed the upcoming birthday party.
