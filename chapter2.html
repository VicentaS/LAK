<div class="text">
<br><p>As Lia and Lexie entered the city with its busy streets full of people, it was not long before they reached their first destination. Dress <br>
  shop where you can only find the most expressive and fancy dresses. Girls left their carriage with accompany of knights and maids.</p><br>

<p>“We’re here! Sister, have you decided on what color do you want your dress to be?” As they entered the shop, Lexie asked her sister.</p><br>

<p>“I don’t know, honestly I didn’t think about it yet. What about you? I’m sure any color would look good on you!”</p><br>

<p>“I was thinking about something light, but I don’t know yet either.”</p><br>

<p>“I see, let’s see what we can find here first. Shall we?”</p><br>

<p>“Yes sister!”</p><br>

<p>As they finished their conversation shop owner appeared before them.</p><br>

<p>“Welcome to the shop ladies! I hope you’ll find what you’re looking for in this shop! If I may ask, what kind of dress are you looking for?”</p><br>

<p>‘They must be from Duke Stewart family’ thought the shop owner looking at the emblems that knights had on their armor. Shield with crossed <br>
  swords, that was Stewarts emblem.</p><br>

<p>“Thank you sir, I’m Lexie Stewart and this is my sister Kaelia Stewart. We came here looking for dresses for our birthday party. Can you show <br>
  us the fanciest dresses you have here?”</p><br>

<p>“Of course my lady, I’ll prepare them right away. Please feel free to relax on the sofa and have some snacks while you’re waiting.”</p><br>

<p>“Thank you sir. Also the price isn’t a concern. The Crown Price will attend this party so we have to look outstanding.</p><br>

<p>“Oh my, of course my lady. If I may ask, will the Crowns Price brother attend this party as well?”</p><br>

<p>“As far as I know he’s not an adult yet, so he won’t be able to come.”</p><br>

<p>“I see... My lady, if you excuse me I shall prepare most expensive and the fanciest dresses we have here, and if I have to, I’ll search all city <br>
  to find dresses that would fit such an occasion.”</p><br>

<p>“Thank you” Said Lexie smiling.</p><br>

<p>‘Oh my, she’s like an angel’ thought the shop owner.</p><br>

<p>Girls sat down while waiting for the shop owner and his assistants to prepare the dresses.</p><br>

<p>“Lexie, sister. I don’t want to bother you and father too much. I’ll be happy with a simple dress, really...”</p><br>

<p>“Lia, don’t worry! It’s our birthday. And the Crown Prince will attend too. We should look beautiful and elegant, worthy of such an occasion. <br>
  Isn’t it?”</p><br>

<p>“You’re right sister. Thank you!” Lia smiled weirdly, as if something is bothering her.</p><br>

<p>Lexie noticed that. She thought it was because Kaelia was a commoner before she feels uncomfortable wearing fancy dresses.</p><br>

<p>Lia deepened into her thoughts. ‘I can’t attract too much attention, what if someone recognizes my face, especially the Crown Prince. I tried <br>
  to...’ It was 5 years since Lia first came into the Stewarts mansion. But before that she was forced to do terrible things. And some people might <br>
  recognize her as that person.</p><br>

<p>“My ladies, the dresses are ready! Please use the dressing room to try them on!”</p><br>

<p>A sudden voice returned Lia to reality. The shop owner with his assistants brought dozen of beautiful expensive dresses.</p><br>

<p>“They’re all so pretty! Which one do you want to try on first sister?”</p><br>

<p>“Well, why don’t you try something on first? I think that deep blue one would look gorgeous on you. Or what about that pink one, it’s so cute. <br>
  Wouldn’t you say?”</p><br>

<p>“Oh, sister. You always do that! And after I’ll choose something you’ll say you’re tired and you want to go home.” Lexie sulked “I’ll choose <br>
  dress for me only after you do! Oh, look! This one is so pretty, just like you, it has soft pink color. Do you want to try it on?” Lexie’s smile <br>
  was as bright as sun.</p><br>

<p>Kaelia couldn’t resist that smile and her argument.</p><br>

<p>“Alright Lex... sister.” it was still hard for Lia to call Lexie sister, not because she didn’t think of her as one, more like she wasn’t used to <br>
  have close relationship with anybody. But Lexie insisted that Lia should call her sister.</p><br>

<p>“You won, I’ll try that one on. Why don’t you try the one with light yellow color in the meantime? It’s so cute!” Kaelia smiled and asked shop owner <br>
  to prepare that one for her sister.</p><br>

<p>“It’s a gorgeous dress, it will fit your beauty sister.” Said Lia.</p><br>

<p>Lexie blushed a little.</p><br>

<p>With help of maids they both tried on the dresses in separate dressing rooms. When they came out, the shop owner lost his words for a second. And <br>
  then said...</p><br>

<p>“Oh my, ladies. If you allow me... you both look gorgeous in these dresses, I have never seen anyone as beautiful as you are right now. The dresses <br>
  fit you perfectly!”</p><br>

<p>“Thank you sir!” Said Lexie with a bright smile. While Kaelia blushed.</p><br>

<p>“Sister, it’s true you look outstanding, and If you add accessories fitting your beauty and this dress, I doubt there’ll be anyone who could compare <br>
  with you on the party.” Said Lia.</p><br>

<p>“Lia, you also look gorgeous! But you’re too kind.” Lexie smiled. “Let’s buy theses dresses, if you like yours. And head straight to the jewelry store, <br>
  what do you say?”</p><br>

<p>“Sounds alright with me.”</p><br>

<p>“Alright then! Sir, we would like to purchase these dresses. Can you deliver them to the Stewart's mansion?”</p><br>

<p>One of the two maids paid for the dresses. Thought they might not wear them on their party, buying new dresses is always fun. They bought them in <br>
  case if they won’t find any better.</p><br>

<p>“Will deliver them tomorrow morning my lady. Always a pleasure doing bossiness with you. Stay safe ladies!”</p><br>

<p>Girls waved him in response and left the store. They’re now heading to a jewelry store. They got back into the carriage and continued to their next <br>
  destination.</p><br>

<p>The jewelry store wasn’t far from the dress shop, so they arrived quickly.</p><br>

<p>They went inside the store, store owner greeted them. Lexie and Kaelia picked the accessories they liked, though Lia was still a bit shy, Lexie convinced <br>
  her to pick the prettiest of them, accessories that would compliment her dress. The same maid paid for the accessories and Lexie asked to deliver it to the <br>
  mansion as well.</p><br>

<p>They left the store, and Lexie spoke.</p><br>

<p>“So, sister, I have to visit some place nearby, would you like to wait for me in the carriage?” Awkwardly smiled Lexie.</p><br>

<p>“Oh, really? I see, I’ll meet you back here then sis!” Lia touched the back of her head with an awkward smile as well. “Please take guards and a maid <br>
  with you!”</p><br>

<p>“Will do sister!” Lexie smiled and took some guards along with a maid with her and departed.</p><br>

<p>Lia put her hands together as if praying, and whispered. “Be safe Lexie.”</p><br>

<p>Kaelia waited for Lexie to disappear from sight, only after that she took her next action. She went inside the carriage with the other maid.</p><br>

<p>“I’ll go now as usual, please keep this as a secret.”</p><br>

<p>“Yes lady Kaelia, this will remain a secret. No need to worry.”</p><br>

<p>Lia took of her accessories and gave them to the maid, tied her hair to try to look as simple as possible.</p><br>

<p>“If you like these you can keep them as a gift form me for keeping my secrets.”</p><br>

<p>“My lady, if I really can. I’ll gladly accept it. But won’t your father say anything about it?”</p><br>

<p>“I’ll just tell him that you saved my life today, somehow, and I gave you that as my gratitude towards your actions. Easy. And no need to speak so formal <br>
  to me when we’re alone.”</p><br>

<p>“Understood lad... Kaelia. Please be back safe!”</p><br>

<p>“Thanks, I will.”</p><br>

<p>Kaelia opened a window inside the carriage on the other side of the door, the knights where guarding door so they didn’t see her slipping away from the <br>
  carriage. With her graceful and light movements, she easily escaped the carriage and run towards a shop she often visited when she was in the city. She took <br>
  some money with her for that reason.</p><br>

<p>It was a smith shop, she entered the place and a warm welcome was waiting for her.</p><br>

<p>“Lia, long time no see! How are you doing these days? Are you eating enough, you got skinnier.” A bright and warm smile appeared on the strong mans face. <br>
  He looked like a rock. A little too serious.</p><br>

<p>“Callan, indeed, long time no see! I’m good, really. You don’t have to worry about me. Better tell me how Mina and Lulu are doing? Do you have enough <br>
  customers to keep you busy?” Lia asked with a smile.</p><br>

<p>Callan was a smith that made some special requested weapons for Kaelia in the past 5 years. Mina is his wife and Lulu is his 5 years old daughter.</p><br>

<p>“They’re both doing well. Lulu is asking me everyday, when will aunty Lia come to play with her. And Mina asked me to tell you that you’re always welcome <br>
  at our house. Hah, as if you didn’t know that! Haha!” A loud laughter spread around the shop.</p><br>

<p>“I’m glad to hear that, and thanks! You guys are too kind too me.” Lia looked down with a warm smile.</p><br>

<p>“Haha, Lia. You’re like a family to us!”</p><br>

<p>‘Family...’ Lia smiled a little sad but at the same time lifted corners of her mouth higher, to make a smile to seem more happy. She didn’t want smith <br>
  to notice her sad smile.</p><br>

<p>Callan saw Lia who was lost in her thoughts, suddenly said.</p><br>

<p>“Ah, Lia. Regarding your order you placed moths ago, it’s finally ready. Took a little longer than I expected. But I wanted to make it perfect. The finest <br>
  and lightest swords I have ever made. Let me bring them too.”</p><br>

<p>“Oh, right! That’s why I’m here. Thank you!”</p><br>

<p>He went in the back of the shop and brought two light middle length swords, along with some small trowing knifes.</p><br>

<p>“As you have requested, they’re light but strong enough to use in a battle. And, you can tie them to your thigh to hide under your dress easily. And these <br>
  small trowing knives so light, that you wouldn’t feel them at all. But as deadly as they seem... is there anything else you would like to order?”</p><br>

<p>“Thank you Callan” Lia took one of the swords to check it. “You have done an excellent work as usual. I can always count on you!”</p><br>

<p>“No, the pleasure is all mine, I’m glad I could help. But is it really ok for you to carry them? I know you said that you needed them for protection, but <br>
  please be careful with them. It’s not a toy.”</p><br>

<p>“Thanks for your concerns Cal! But I need them to protect my sister, not only myself. And I know to handle them, no need to worry!” Lia took a bag with gold <br>
  and gave it to Callan.</p><br>

<p>‘And in case if assassins are going to find me one day, I’ll need a way to fight back’</p><br>

<p>“I see... Oh, this is more than I asked for these weapons Lia.”</p><br>

<p>“I know, use the rest to buy something for Lulu from me! I miss her too, but I’m afraid I won’t be able to play with her in a while now. I’m too busy lately.”</p><br>

<p>“Oh, well, thank you for you kindness!” Smith smiled nervously, the price she paid was almost twice the original price.</p><br>

<p>“Can I try them on somewhere quite? I want to see if anyone would see them under my dress.”</p><br>

<p>“Yes, please use the back room, no one will disturb you there.”</p><br>

<p>“Thank you.” Lia walked into the room, and tied both swords on each side of her thighs. And trowing knifes around her bottom back where the skirt of her <br>
  dress starts. Then she went outside where smith was.</p><br>

<p>“Wow, it’s handy to wear a dress. If I wouldn’t know you have weapons under, I couldn’t see it at all.”</p><br>

<p>“Hmm... but it’s still noticeable if you’re used to weapons, right?”</p><br>

<p>Callan didn’t know how to respond. And Lia continued.</p><br>

<p>“Perhaps I really have to wear a fancier dress, more fluffy... and with a separate skirt, so I can take it off if I have to...” Lia made a thinking posture.</p><br>

<p>“Hah, I bet with that dress, even a sharp eye wouldn’t see that you have weapons hidden there.”</p><br>

<p>“Yes, you’re right. Thank you Callan for everything! Please take care of yourself and your family, and I hope we will see each other soon.”</p><br>

<p>“You too Lia! Take care.”</p><br>

<p>Kaelia left the shop, and she had a little time before her sister returns to the carriage. So she hurried to her last stop. Specialized jewelry store.</p><br>

<p>She placed an order there around a moth ago, a gift for her sisters birthday.</p><br>

<p>Along the way she bumped into a person in cloak with hood on his head.</p><br>

<p>“Auch... careful there lady.” Person said.</p><br>

<p>“Oh... I’m really sorry! I’m in a hurry. Please excuse me.”</p><br>

<p>‘Where did I see her?...’ the man looked at the lady as she left in a hurry.</p><br>

<p>‘Oh, she dropped something’ he took a bag from the ground and went after her.</p><br>
