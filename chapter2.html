  <div class="line">
  As Lia and Lexie entered the city with its busy streets full of people, it was not long before they reached their first destination. Dress shop where you can only find the most expressive and fancy dresses. Girls left their carriage with accompany of knights and maids.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “We’re here! Sister, have you decided on what color do you want your dress to be?” As they entered the shop, Lexie asked her sister.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “I don’t know, honestly I didn’t think about it yet. What about you? I’m sure any color would look good on you!”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “I was thinking about something light, but I don’t know yet either.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “I see, let’s see what we can find here first. Shall we?”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Yes sister!”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  As they finished their conversation shop owner appeared before them.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Welcome to the shop ladies! I'm sure you’ll find what you’re looking for in this shop! If I may ask, what kind of dress are you looking for?”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  ‘They must be from Stewart family’ thought the shop owner looking at the emblems that knights had on their armor. Shield with crossed swords, that was Stewart's family emblem.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Thank you sir, I’m Lexie Stewart and this is my sister Kaelia Stewart. We came here looking for dresses for our birthday party. Can you show us the fanciest dresses you have here?”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Of course my lady, I’ll prepare them right away. Please feel free to relax on the sofa and have some snacks while you’re waiting.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Thank you sir. Also the price isn’t a concern. The Crown Price will attend this party so we have to look outstanding!"
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Oh my, of course my lady. If I may ask, will the Crown Price's brother attend this party as well?”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “As far as I know he’s not an adult yet, so he won’t be able to come.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “I see... My lady, if you excuse me I shall prepare the most expensive and the fanciest dresses we have here, dresses that would fit such an occasion.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Thank you” Said Lexie smiling.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  ‘Oh my, she’s like an angel.’ thought the shop owner looking at Lexie smiling.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  Girls sat down while waiting for the shop owner and his assistants to prepare the dresses.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Lexie, sister. I don’t want to bother you and father too much. I’ll be happy with a simple dress, really...”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Lia, don’t worry! It’s our birthday. And the Crown Prince will attend too. We should look beautiful and elegant, worthy of such an occasion. Isn’t it?”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “You’re right sister. Thank you...” Lia smiled weirdly, as if something is bothering her. 'I can't attent the party, it's too risky...'
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  Lexie noticed that. She thought it was because Kaelia was probaly a commoner before, and she feels uncomfortable wearing fancy dresses.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  Lia deepened into her thoughts. ‘I can’t attract too much attention, what if someone recognizes my face, especially the Crown Prince. I tried to...’
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  It was 5 years since Lia first came into the Stewart's mansion. But before that, she was forced to do terrible things. Lia said she didn't remember a thing about her past, though it was a true in some ways, she can crealy remember the darkest times in her life.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  'I wish I never return to that... I can't let them find me! Not now, when I have Lexie...'
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “My ladies, the dresses are ready! Please use the dressing room to try them on!”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  A sudden voice returned Lia to reality. The shop owner with his assistants brought dozen of beautiful expensive dresses.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “They’re all so pretty! Which one do you want to try on first sister?” said Lexie.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Well, why don’t you try something on first? I think that deep blue one would look gorgeous on you. Or what about that pink one, it’s so cute. Wouldn’t you say?”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Oh, sister. You always do that! And after I’ll choose something you’ll say you’re tired and you want to go home.” Lexie sulked “I’ll choose dress for me only after you do! Oh, look! This one is so pretty, just like you, it has soft pink color. Do you want to try it on?” Lexie’s smile was as bright as the sun.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  Kaelia couldn’t resist that smile and her argument.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Alright Lex... sister.” it was still hard for Lia to call Lexie sister, not because she didn’t think of her as one, more like she wasn’t used to have close relationships with anybody. But Lexie insisted that Lia should call her sister.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “You won, I’ll try that one on. Why don’t you try the one with light yellow color in the meantime? It’s so cute!” Kaelia smiled and asked shop owner to prepare that one for her sister.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “It’s a gorgeous dress, it will fit your beauty sister.” Said Lia.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  Lexie blushed a little, she smiled and made her way to the dressing room next to Kaelia.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  With help of maids they both tried on the dresses in separate dressing rooms. When they came out, the shop owner lost his words for a second. And then said:
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Oh my, ladies. If you allow me... you both look gorgeous in these dresses, I have never seen anyone as beautiful as you are right now. The dresses fit you perfectly!”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Thank you sir!” Said Lexie with a bright smile. While Kaelia blushed.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Sister, it’s true you look outstanding, and If you add accessories fitting your beauty to this dress, I doubt there’ll be anyone who could compare with you on the party.” Said Lia.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Lia, you also look gorgeous! You’re too kind.” Lexie smiled. “Let’s buy theses dresses, if you like yours. And head straight to the jewelry store, what do you say?”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Sounds alright with me.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Alright then! Sir, we would like to purchase these dresses. Can you deliver them to the Stewart mansion?”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  One of the two maids paid for the dresses. Thought they might not wear them on their party, buying new dresses is always fun.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Will deliver them tomorrow morning my lady. Always a pleasure doing bussiness with you. Stay safe ladies!”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  Girls waved him in response and left the store. They’re now heading to a jewelry store. They got back into the carriage and continued to their next destination.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  The jewelry store wasn’t far from the dress shop, so they arrived there quickly.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  They went inside the store, store owner greeted them. Lexie and Kaelia picked the accessories they liked, though Lia was still a bit shy, Lexie convinced her to pick the prettiest of them, accessories that would compliment her dress. The same maid paid for the accessories and Lexie asked to deliver them to the mansion as well.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  They left the store, and Lexie spoke.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “So, sister... I have to visit some place nearby, would you like to wait for me in the carriage?” Awkwardly smiled Lexie.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Oh, really? I see, I’ll meet you back here then sis!” Lia touched the back of her head with an awkward smile as well. “Please take guards and a maid with you and be careful!”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Will do sister!” Lexie smiled and took some guards along with a maid with her and departed.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  Lia put her hands together as if praying, and whispered. “Be safe Lexie.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  Kaelia waited for Lexie to disappear from sight, only after that she took her next action. She went inside the carriage with the other maid.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Lillian, I’ll go now as usual, please keep this as a secret.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Yes lady Kaelia, this will remain a secret. No need to worry.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  Lia took of her accessories and gave them to the maid, tied her hair to look as simple as possible, like anu other commoner.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  Lia noticed how her maid Lillian looked at the acessories she gace her. “If you like these you can keep them as a gift from me for keeping my secrets.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “My lady, if I really can. I’ll gladly accept it. But won’t your father say anything about it?”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “I’ll just tell him that you saved my life today, somehow... and I gave you that as my gratitude towards your actions. Easy. And no need to speak so formal to me when we’re alone.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Understood lady... Kaelia. Please be back safe!”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Thanks, I will.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  Kaelia opened a window inside the carriage on the other side of the door, the knights where guarding door so they didn’t see her slipping away from the carriage. With her graceful and light movements, she easily escaped the carriage and run towards a shop she often visited when she was in the city. She took some money with her for that reason as well.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  It was a smith shop, she entered the place and a warm welcome was waiting her.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Little Lia, long time no see! How are you doing these days? Are you eating enough, you got skinnier.” A bright and warm smile appeared on the strong mans face. He looked like a rock. He had white hair, grey eyes and dark skin. He was the kindest person Lia have ever met, after Lexie of course.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Callan, indeed, long time no see! I’m good, really. You don’t have to worry about me. Better tell me how are Mina and Lulu doing? Do you have enough customers to keep you busy?” Lia asked with a smile.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  Callan was a smith that made some specialy requested weapons for Kaelia in the past 5 years. Mina is his wife and Lulu is his 5 years old daughter.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “They’re both doing well. Lulu is asking me everyday, when will aunty Lia come to play with her. And Mina asked me to tell you that you’re always welcome at our house. Hah, as if you didn’t know that alredy! Haha!” A loud laughter spread around the shop.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “I’m glad to hear that, and thanks! You guys are too kind too me.” Lia looked down with a warm smile.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Haha, Lia. You’re like a family to us!”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  ‘Family...’ Lia smiled a little sad but at the same time lifted corners of her mouth higher, to make a smile to seem more happy.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  Callan saw Lia who was lost in her thoughts, and suddenly said.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Ah, Lia. Regarding your order you placed moths ago, it’s finally ready. Took a little longer than I expected. But I wanted to make it perfect. The finest and lightest swords I have ever made. Let me bring them to you.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Oh, right! Yes, that’s why I’m here. Thank you!”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  He went in the back of the shop and brought two light middle length swords, along with some small trowing knifes.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “As you have requested, they’re light but strong enough to use in a battle. And, you can tie them to your thigh to hide under your dress easily. And there scabbars are made specially for you! Also these small trowing knives are so light that you wouldn’t feel them at all. But as deadly as they seem... is there anything else you would like to order?”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Thank you Callan.” Lia took one of the swords to check it out. “You have done an excellent work as usual. I can always count on you!”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “No, the pleasure is all mine, I’m glad I could help. But is it really alright for you to carry them? I know you said that you needed them for training, but please be careful with them. It’s not a toy.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Thanks for your concerns Cal! But that's exactly why I need them, real swords will make my training even more efficient. And I know how to handle them, no need to worry!” Lia took a bag with gold and gave it to Callan.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  ‘And in case if assassins are going to find me one day, I’ll need a way to fight back. My old swords are used up alredy and not as sharp as I wanted them to be.’
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “I see... Oh, this is more than I asked for these weapons Lia.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “I know, use the rest of the gold to buy something for Lulu from me! I miss her too, but I’m afraid I won’t be able to play with her in a while now. I’m too busy lately.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Oh, well, thank you for you kindness!” Smith smiled nervously, the price she paid was almost twice the original price.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Can I try them on somewhere quite? I want to see if anyone would see them under my dress.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Yes, please use the back room, no one will disturb you there.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Thank you.” Lia walked into the room, and tied both swords on each side of her thighs. And trowing knifes around her bottom back where the skirt of her dress starts. Then she went outside where smith was.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Wow, it’s handy to wear a dress. If I wouldn’t know you have weapons under, I couldn’t see it at all.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Hmm... but it’s still noticeable if you’re used to weapons, right?”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  Callan didn’t know how to respond. And Lia continued.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Perhaps I really have to wear a fancier dress, more fluffy... and with a separate skirt, so I can take it off if I have to...” Lia made a thinking posture.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Hah, I bet with that dress, even a sharp eye wouldn’t see that you have weapons hidden there.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Yes, you’re right. Thank you Callan for everything! Please take care of yourself and your family, and I hope we will see each other soon.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “You too Lia! Take care.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  Kaelia left the shop, and she had a little time before her sister returns to the carriage. Lia knew exactly where Lexie went. So she hurried to her last stop. Specialized jewelry store.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  She placed an order there around a moth ago, a gift for her sisters birthday.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  Along the way she bumped into a person in cloak with hood on his head.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Auch... careful there young lady.” Stranger said.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Oh... I’m really sorry! I’m in a hurry. Please excuse me.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  ‘Where did I see her?...’ the man looked at Kaelia as she left in a hurry.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  ‘Oh, she dropped something’ he took a bag from the ground and went after her.
  </div>
