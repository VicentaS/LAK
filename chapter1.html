  <div class="header-chapter1"><h3>Chapter 1: Kingdom guardian Stewart family</h3></div>

<div class="text">
  <div class="line">In a dark room, there was Kaelia standing in front of a person with golden eyes wearing a bloody red cloak and a mask with horns.</div>

  <div class="line">“You remember your mission, right Kaelia? The second prince of the kingdom, that’s your target. Don’t forget...”</div>

  <div class="line">‘Again, that dream.’ More like a nightmare from the past, if you ask me. Lia woke up, but kept her eyes closed.</div>

  <div class="line">“Lia, wake up! We’re going to be late. How can you still be asleep!”</div>

  <div class="line">Exhausted Lia opened her eyes from a sudden sound of someone calling her. Her emerald eyes turned to the source of that sound, she had wavy, long pale gold hair.</div>

  <div class="line">“Lexie! What time is it? Why are you here?”</div>

  <div class="line">It was her sister Lexie, and a maid who stood behind her. Lexie with her blue sky like eyes and straight and long brunette hair. She’s a kind and sweet child. And her bright smile can make everyone’s heart melt.</div>

  <div class="line">“Did you have a nightmare again? Ohh, sister... you look exhausted. Is there anything I can do to make you feel better?”</div>

  <div class="line">“It’s ok Lexie, no need to worry. Thank you. You said we were late, right? Let’s start our preparation then.”</div>

  <div class="line">“Right! Do you want anything in particular for our breakfast. I can ask maids to prepare it for you!”</div>

  <div class="line">“Well, if you insist... I would like something cold and refreshing for a drink, if that’s not too much to ask.”</div>

  <div class="line">Kaelia smiled softly at her sister.</div>

  <div class="line">“Got it!”</div>

  <div class="line">And Lexie asked to add refreshing drinks to their breakfast, the maid who was standing behind her bowed and left the room.</div>

  <div class="line">Kaelia and Lexie were daughters of the Duke Stewart family, second most powerful family after the Royal family. Though Lia was adopted by the family around 5 years ago. Still, both of them act like real sisters.</div>

  <div class="line">Stewart family is a family of knights, that swore to protect the royal family. That and also they have some kind of magical ability that passes though generations. Some other families from the kingdom also have their own abilities, as families in other counties have.</div>

  <div class="line">Stewart’s family ability is to summon and control summoned weapons as they please. How many weapons they can summon and how powerful they are, depends on the magical strength that person has. It is said that Lexie’s ancestor the most powerful among them, could summon handers of such weapons and easily defeat an army with those. Lexie can summon up to three weapons now, but they are all powerful enough, and she can still grow in strength. Her father however can summon up to twenty.</div>

  <div class="line">Today was a day they decided to go shopping for some new dresses and accessories for their birthday party. It was their day off, since they usually have to study hard, it was a perfect day to relax and have fun together. Kaelia didn’t remember anything from her past, that includes her birthday. So family decided to celebrate their daughters birthday on the same day.</div>

  <div class="line">Crown prince decided to visit their party this year, so Lexie was very excited about it. Kaelia on the other hand was a little nervous. How can she, who was probably a commoner before, with no abilities, meet one of the royal family members. At least that what she told Lexie.</div>

  <div class="line">Lexie Stewart found Kaelia in the city close to the royal palace with a huge sword cut on her back, if Lexie didn’t find her, she would die that day, or someone else could have killed her...</div>

  <div class="line">Kaelia said she doesn’t remember what happened, that she lost her memories about her past on that day. Except for her name. Though, partially it was true, she doesn’t remember who her parents were, and where are they now, but she can clearly remember what happened that day and years of terrifying life before that.</div>

  <div class="line">Lexie was 15 years old, since Kaelia’s real age was unknown, even to Kaelia, Lexie’s father decided that she must be around same age too. Their height is almost same, expect that Kaelia is a little bit higher than Lexie. But Lexie’s clothes fit Lia almost perfectly.</div>

  <div class="line">Kaelia and Lexie were ready to go down for the breakfast with help of maids.</div>

  <div class="line">“Are you ready sister?” Excited Lexie asked Lia.</div>

  <div class="line">“Yes. Let’s get down, father’s probably waiting for us.”</div>

  <div class="line">“Yes” Lexie smiled at Lia and nodded.</div>

  <div class="line">Lexie was wearing a beautiful pale gold dress, she liked that color because it was color of her sisters hair. With beautiful shoes and a ribbon on her hairs of the same color. Along with fancy accessories. While Kaelia was wearing a simple beige dress, without any accessories.</div>

  <div class="line">As they were coming downstairs to the dinning room, Lexie noticed her sisters simple dress and said.</div>

  <div class="line">“Lia, you’re a noble woman, and still I never saw you wearing a fancy dress that would fit your status as a noble. Except for parties I mean. Is there something wrong?”</div>

  <div class="line">Lexie looked at her sister with concerned face.</div>

  <div class="line">“I don’t know... it’s just more comfortable to wear a simple dress. I can move more freely and be more flexible when I have to.”</div>

  <div class="line">‘And it’s easier to reach my weapon that’s tied to my thigh whenever we go outside, if we face any danger, but I can’t say that to you sister.’</div>

  <div class="line">“If that makes you comfortable then I’m happy! But you could still wear some accessories though.”</div>

  <div class="line">“Yes, you’re right sister. I’ll take some on before we leave.”</div>

  <div class="line">They entered dinning room where Duke Kane, their father was waiting for them to start their meal.</div>

  <div class="line">“Lexie, Lia, you’re here. Please, sit down.”</div>

  <div class="line">Lexies mother died from a disease that couldn’t be cured. Lexie barely can remember her face, so it was up to Kane and maids to take care of her.</div>

  <div class="line">“Yes, father” Lexie replied and sat.</div>

  <div class="line">“Thanks father” Lia did the same.</div>

  <div class="line">They started their meal in silence. When they almost finished, Kane stated speaking.</div>

  <div class="line">“So, what are your plans for today? Your birthday is around the corner. Have you decided on what dresses are you going to be wearing? Crown prince will visit us, you must have picked the fanciest dresses, didn’t you?”</div>

  <div class="line">“Not yet father. We’re going to the city today to buy dresses, but rest assured they’re going to be the prettier dresses you have ever seen. At least we will try to find them, hehe...” said Lexie and slightly laughed.</div>

  <div class="line">“I see. If you won’t find anything to your liking, you can always ask a tailor to make you some. I can ask butler to invite one today, if you want.”</div>

  <div class="line">“Thank you father, you’re too kind. But we also wanted to walk around the city too. We have to prepare gifts for each other.” Lexie smiled.</div>

  <div class="line">“Speaking of gifts, do you know what do you and your sister want for your birthday? Pick whatever you want and I shall give it to you.”</div>

  <div class="line">“Father, you’re going to spoil us. Thank you! If it’s not too much for you, can I ask you to find a tailor that can make fancy but comfortable dresses for Lia then, so she can feel comfortable. The dresses she has are all simple, though they look good on her, I want her to wear something that would fit her status as a noble. If she doesn’t mind it.”</div>

  <div class="line">“Sister...” said Lia with embarrassed face.</div>

  <div class="line">“Lia, what do you think?” Asked Kane.</div>

  <div class="line">“I.. I will gladly accept such a gift father.”</div>

  <div class="line">“I’ll do my best Lexie. But do you want anything for yourself?”</div>

  <div class="line">“No father. I already have everything I have ever dreamed of. A kind father, the best sister, fancy dresses and accessories. What else can I ask for?”</div>

  <div class="line">“I see, I’m glad you’re happy dear. What about you Lia?”</div>

  <div class="line">“Um.. Father.. thank you for asking. But as long as Lexie’s happy I’m happy too.”</div>

  <div class="line">“Look at you girls, so shy! I guess I’ll have to choose something myself. Even if you say you don’t want anything, it’s your birthday girls. I’ll make sure to prepare something great!”</div>

  <div class="line">“Father, you really don’t have to! But thank you, you’re too kind!” Said Lexie trying not to show her embarrassment.</div>

  <div class="line">“Thank you father.” Said Lia.</div>

  <div class="line">“Haha, save your thanks for the actual gifts!”</div>

  <div class="line">“Father, what about you? Do you have any plans for today?” Lexie asked Kane.</div>

  <div class="line">“Yes. The king asked me to attend the training of new knights today. Since I’m the head of the royal knights, my presence is required.”</div>

  <div class="line">“Oh, that’s wonderful father! I hope the training will go smoothly. Don’t over work today!” Said Lexie with all her sincerity.</div>

  <div class="line">“Take care of yourself father.” Said Lia.</div>

  <div class="line">“Thank you girls. I hope your day will go without any troubles as well. And will see you at the dinner.”</div>

  <div class="line">Girls nodded. As everyone finished their meal, they left the dining room and started preparing to leave the mansion.</div>

  <div class="line">“Lexie, sister.. I’m going to take on some accessories and I’ll be back in a minute.”</div>

  <div class="line">“Alright, I’ll wait for you in the carriage!” Lexie smiled and went outside with some maids and knights.</div>

  <div class="line">Kaelia went to her room and asked maids to leave her there alone. She checked her weapons, but decided not to take any right now. She had other plans. She put on a red corset and cloth on top of her white dress and she picked a necklace and a bracelet with the same design.</div>

  <div class="line">“That should be enough”</div>

  <div class="line">Kaelia went down and made her way to the carriage that was waiting. She said next to her sister.</div>

  <div class="line">“It looks good on you sister!” Said Lexie with excitement taking about her accessories.</div>

  <div class="line">“I’m glad you liked it.” Softly smiled Lia.</div>

  <div class="line">And the carriage made its way to the city. The mansion was located in forest with beautiful view. Duke owned a vast land with a small village in it. And a city with the royal palace in its center was not too far from the mansion.</div>
