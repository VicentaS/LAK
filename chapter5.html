    <div class="text">

        <div class="line">Next morning the dresses and jewelry have arrived at the mansion.
        Then few days have passed, and it was a week before the day of
        their birthday party. Kaelia was in her room writing something
            in her diary.</div>



        <div class="line"> ‘I’m still thinking on the plan for my revenge, it has to be
        perfect. Almost 5 years have passed, but I have to think of every
        possible situation. I have to prepare thoroughly. They’re strong
        together, but if I have a chance to split them one by one, I might
        have a chance. Ugh...’ Kaelia put her hands on her head and messed
        up her hair.</div>



        <div class="line">Someone knocked on the door.</div>



        <div class="line">“Sister are you awake? It’s almost breakfast time.”</div>



        <div class="line">  “Oh, yes! Please sister, come in!”</div>



        <div class="line">Kaelia closed her diary and put it under her bed in a hurry.
        Lexie walked into the room.</div>



        <div class="line"> “Good morning Lia!” Lexies bright smile made Lias bad thoughts
        go away.</div>



        <div class="line"> “Morning sister. You look as beautiful as always. I hope you
        slept well!”</div>



        <div class="line">  “Thank you! Oh my, what happened to your hair? Did you have a
        bad dream again?” Lexie looked worried.</div>



        <div class="line"> “Haha...” Lia made an awkward smile “No, it’s fine! I probably
        was clumsy while sleeping and moved a lot. No need to worry.”</div>



        <div class="line"> “If you say so...” Lexie made a worried expression.</div>



        <div class="line">  “I’m going to get ready and go down for the breakfast, if you
        want you can stay here while I’m getting ready?”</div>



        <div class="line">  “Yes, I’ll! No need to hurry. Father didn’t come down yet, so
        take your time.”</div>



        <div class="line">  Kaelia smiled and stood from her bed. She started dressing up
        and fixing her messed hair with help of maids.</div>



        <div class="line"> “Lex.. Sister, do you have any plans for today after we finish
        our classes?” Kaelia said while preparing.</div>



        <div class="line"> “Yes! I wanted to ask if you would like to ride horses with me
        at the forest.” Lexie made a sad face. “But the knights are
        still unable to find those bandits, so I guess we can spend some
        time at the mansion garden instead. What would you say?”</div>



        <div class="line"> “I see...” Lia thought of something. ‘I also went to investigate
        few times at night, but I didn’t find even a slight trace of
        them. That’s unfortunate...’</div>



        <div class="line">“Oh, if you don’t want to, thanks ok! We can still do something
        else!” Lexies words returned Lia back from her thoughts.</div>



        <div class="line"> “I’m sorry, I just thought it’s strange that the knights can’t
        find them yet, maybe they are not our regular bandits.” Kaelia
        made a weird face as if she said something silly.</div>



        <div class="line">Lexies face looked worried at Lias words. Kaelia noticed it.</div>



        <div class="line">  “Or maybe... there are no bandits to begin with. Villagers
        probably mistook some travelers for bandits. And they already
        left the forest. No need to worry, no one got hurt yet, right?”</div>



        <div class="line">“Yes, you are probably right!” Lexies mood lifted.</div>



        <div class="line">“Well then, let’s visit our horses after classes, and then go
        to the garden. What do you think?”</div>



        <div class="line">“Wonderful! Let’s do that!”</div>



        <div class="line"> Lia dressed up and fixed her hair.</div>



        <div class="line"> “Well, I’m ready. Let’s get down now.”</div>



        <div class="line"> Lexie nodded and they went downstairs. They arrived to the
        dinning room at the same time as Kane, greeted each other and
        had their meals. After breakfast Kane went to the royal palace
        and girls started their classes: etiquette and manners, history,
        economics and finances, language classes. Time went by fast, it
        was lunch time, after that they had few more classes and finally
        their study time had come to an end.</div>



        <div class="line">“Sister, are you ready to go to the stables?” Said Lexie.</div>



        <div class="line">“Yes, let’s go!” Lia smiled and they made their way to the
        mansion stables.</div>



        <div class="line">“My ladies.” Stable master bowed greeting girls.</div>



        <div class="line">“William! We came to see Izzy and Thunder. Are they doing
        alright?” Asked Lexie.</div>



        <div class="line">Izzy short for Isabel was Lexies horse, she’s a beautiful and
        elegant white as snow horse. And Thunder was Kaelias horse,
        he’s fast as lighting and had pitch black color, his name
        speaks for himself.</div>



        <div class="line">“Yes my lady. I’ll prepare them for you right now.”</div>



        <div class="line">“Actually, we can’t go outside right now. We just wanted
        to see them.”</div>



        <div class="line">“Understood. I guess the knights didn’t find those bandits
        yet. Please, follow me.”</div>



        <div class="line">“Yes. Thank you William!”</div>



        <div class="line">They followed him to the stables were their horses were resting.</div>



        <div class="line">“Izzy!” Lexie excitedly came to pet her horse giving her some carrots.</div>



        <div class="line">“Did you miss me Izzy? You’re my cutie girl. Who’s a good girl?
        who’s a good girl!” Lexie pet her.</div>



        <div class="line">“Thunder. Did you miss me?” Lia came to Tornado speaking softly
        with a smile on her face.</div>



        <div class="line">Thunder started happily whinnying and lowered his head. He was
        3 years old, Duke Kane gave him to Lia on one of her birthdays.
        Ever since they were inseparable. Izzy was 5 years old and Lexie
        liked spending time with her.</div>



        <div class="line">They spend some more time with their horses, then Lexie asked
        William to prepare their bridles and they walked around the mansion
        together. After that William took horses back to their stables and
        girls went to the mansion garden. They walked a little talking about
        different things girls like to talk and stopped in front of a fountain.</div>



        <div class="line">“Aaahh... I’m so exhausted.” Said Lexie. “What a nice day it was,
        don’t you say Lia?”</div>



        <div class="line">“Yes, indeed. So peaceful...” Lia starred somewhere far with a
        calm exprssion.</div>



        <div class="line">“You know... I’m so happy to have you as my sister! When I found
        you in that alley in the city, I was so terrified, you were so
        badly injured...” Lexie made worried face. “Whoever did that to
        you, they won’t be able to hurt you now, I’ll protect you Lia!
        I’ll work hard and become really-really strong!”</div>



        <div class="line">‘Ohhhh, Lexie. You’re so cute! I’m blessed to have sister like
        you! But I’ll be the one to protect you, you don’t know who my
        enemies are. They are indeed terrifying...” Lia closed her eyes
        and smiled softly.</div>



        <div class="line">“I can count on you little sis.” Said Lia with teasing smile.</div>



        <div class="line">“I’m not you little sister, we’re the same age! Call me big sister!”
        Lexie sulked at Lia.</div>



        <div class="line">“Alright alright, big sis. But you already can summon 3 powerful
        weapons, you’re strong enough right now. Just don’t over do it.”</div>



        <div class="line">“I won’t Lia! Don’t worry! But I’ll do my best!” Lexie smiled
        brightly.</div>



        <div class="line">'It's the opposite of not over doing...' Lia smiled.</div>


        <div class="line">“It’s almost dinner time, and father should be home soon. Shall
        we go inside? It’s getting cold here.” said Lia.</div>



        <div class="line">“Yes sister!”</div>



        <div class="line">They went inside. Soon Duke Kane arrived at the mansion and they
        were about to have a dinner together.</div>



        <div class="line">Lia sitting in her room waiting for maids to call her for the
        dinner, she took her diary and continued on her plan.
        </div>


        <div class="line">‘They are powerful, yes. But splitting them apart is actually a
        good idea. Now, how do I do that? If I take them one by one
        slowly, they might suspect something. I have to do it fast.’
        And she started writing something in her diary. ‘Also, about
        those bandits. I have to gather some intel from villagers they
        might know more details... and knights too.’</div>



        <div class="line">Someone knocked on the door. And Kaelia hurried to hide her
        diary under her bed.</div>



        <div class="line">“My lady, sir Duke Kane arrived, and the dinner is about to be
        served.” A maid talked through the door. It was Lillian,
        Kaelia's maid.</div>



        <div class="line">“Alright. You can come inside. I need your help to prepare.”</div>



        <div class="line">“Yes my lady.”</div>



        <div class="line">The maid came inside and helped Lia change her dress and fix
        her hair. Kaelia came downstairs to the dining room.</div>



        <div class="line">“Father, Lexie it’s nice to see you.”</div>



        <div class="line">“Kaelia, I hope you’re doing alright.” Said Kane.</div>



        <div class="line">“Sister!”</div>



        <div class="line">‘Lexie, you’re so excited to see me, even thought we spent
        almost all day together.’ Lia made an awkward smile.</div>



        <div class="line">“How was your day at the royal palace father? Any news?”
        Asked Lia after sitting next to Lexie.</div>



        <div class="line">“It was busy, we had to raise security at the palace. I also
        supervised the newcomers training today as well. Busy day.”</div>



        <div class="line">“Oh father, I hope you’re not too hard on yourself. Work is
        work, but you have to take care of yourself!” Said worried Lexie.</div>



        <div class="line">“Thank you Lexie. I will.”</div>



        <div class="line">‘Huh? Raise the security? Did something happen? That’s weird!”
        Lia looked concerned.</div>



        <div class="line">“Don’t over do it father. Is everything alright at the palace?
        Crown prince’s birthday is few moths from now.” Kaelia thought
        for a moment ‘And the second prince’s birthday is even further
        away.’</div>



        <div class="line">“Ahh.. it’s just...” Kane made a serious face. ‘Should I really
        tell them that the assassins on their move again. That’s going
        to make them worry.’</div>



        <div class="line">“Oh no, did something terrible happen?” Lexie looked worried.</div>



        <div class="line">“Nothing serious, really. You don’t have to worry dear. By the
        way, Lia, I found a capable tailor for you, as Lexie have requested.
        Do you want me to invite her over?”</div>



        <div class="line">As Kane finished, Lia thought of something ‘Something must have
        happened, they wouldn’t just raise the security for no reason.
        They’re expecting something.’ Lia looked serious, as Kane voice
        reached her.</div>



        <div class="line">“Lia?”</div>



        <div class="line">“Sorry father, I was lost in my thoughts, didn’t hear the
        conversation, sorry” Lia smiled awkwardly.</div>



        <div class="line">“I was asking if you would like me to invite the tailor to the
        mansion, as Lexie requested.” repeated Kane.
        </div>


        <div class="line">“Thank you, you’re too kind. If you could, I would like to see
        her tomorrow.”</div>



        <div class="line">“No problem, I’ll send her a letter then.”</div>



        <div class="line">“Thank you father, Lexie.” Lia thanked them and smiled.</div>



        <div class="line">Kane asked his butler to invite the tailor over to the mansion
        tomorrow. They finished dinner and everyone went into their rooms.</div>



        <div class="line">It was already midnight. Lia noticed a carriage preparing to
        depart from the mansion through her window.</div>



        <div class="line">'Why would someone go somewhere this late? The only people who
        could use carriage in this place are Kane, Lexie and me... And
        Lexie is definitely in her room. Though I cleary remember Kane
        going to his room as well, noone came in or left his room ever
        since. AT least I didn;t hear anyone's footsteps...'</div>



        <div class="line">At the same time Kaelia tied her swords to her thighs and some
        other weapons and changed into a comfortable dress so it’s easy
        to move in it. When she sneaked outside through a window in her
        room, she saw that the carriage was leaving.</div>
