  Lia reached her destination, and hurried inside the jewelry store.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Welcome lady Kaelia! I hope your way here was safe and smooth.” Store owner greeted Lia.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Thank you sir.” She nodded and said “It was.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Are you here regarding your order you placed a month ago?”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Yes, is it ready yet?”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Yes, it was ready for a while now, but as you requested I kept it here. Give me a moment.” store owner asked his assistant to show Lia the brooch she had ordered.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Here, just as you requested” he showed her the brooch “Light blue color, just like clear sky at day time, with a shape like a moon. Also with gold platting around it. And an engraving on back says [To my dear sister Lexie.] Are you satisfied with the work of our master?”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Yes, I am. It’s a beautiful brooch. Tell your master he did an amazing job.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “You’re too kind lady Kaelia.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  As she was about to take her bag of gold out of a pocket on her dress, she realized.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  ‘Oh no, where is it. I can’t find it.’ Then she remembered a time when she bumped on that starnger on the street.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  ‘No, it can’t be. Did I drop it there? I have to hurry back. But I don’t have time.’ As she was panicking, the store owner said.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “I see, you don’t have a maid with you. Should I request payment from Stewart family instead? It’s not a big deal. Stewart is a trusted family all around the kingdom.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  ‘But I can’t, I wanted it to be a secret. If father will see this bill, he will ask both of us who purchased it, and Lexie will guess what kind of gift I have prepared for her.’ As she panicked even more, a stranger in cloak appeared behind her.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Lady, you dropped it on the street.” The stranger gave her a bag with gold, with every last gold coin in it.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  She couldn’t speak for a moment. ‘How can someone see a bag filled with gold and return it to its owner, without even thinking of keeping it. Maybe he’s really rich, or just a stupidly kind person. Or both.’
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Is everything alright lady Stewart? Do you know this man?” Store owner spoke to Lia, and she returned from her thoughts.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Ah yes, I’m alright.” Lia looked at the stranger. “Thank you very much kind sir. I will not forget your kindness. I shall repay you for your kind action.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  Stranger smiled.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “No need my lady. I just did what was right. But if you could, please be careful next time. It’s dangerous to walk the streets without any guards. Especially for a noble lady as yourself.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  ‘Oh, I can protect myself. You don’t have to worry about me. But...’
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “...thank you sir.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Then, I shall be going.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “May I know your name kind sir?” Asked Lia.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  The stranger looked a bit surprised. “I’m just a friendly stranger”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  ‘A friendly what now? Alright, don’t want to give me your name, that’s fine.’
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Take care of yourself as well friendly sir” politely spoke Lia.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  As the stranger was about to leave the store, he turned around and looked at Lia who was giving gold coins to the store owner.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  ‘I swear I saw her somewhere. The store owner said she’s from the Stewart family. Shall I attend the upcoming party as well, though maybe not officially?’
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  And the stranger left thinking what should he do.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  Lia paid for the brooch and hurried back to the carriage.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  ‘I hope she is not there yet. I have to hurry!’
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  The carriage was still there, and still no sight of other knights that Lexie took with her.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  ‘I made it on time. Thanks God!’
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  She knocked on window on the other side of the carriage really quite so only the maid inside could hear that. Maid opened the window for her, and Lia hopped inside the carriage, without making any noise, so that the guards on the other side wouldn’t hear her.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Nothing bad happened while I was away I hope?” Lia asked the maid.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Kaelia, you’re fine! Everything was fine. Guards didn’t notice your absence. Did you get what you went for?”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Yes, my sisters brooch was ready. Everything went smoothly.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “But it took you longer than I expected.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Yes, I lost my bag of gold on the way there. So I had to go back to find it. Thankfully I found it untouched.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  ‘I can’t tell her I went to the smith and met a strangely kind person on my way. She will start questioning me...’
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Oh my, I’m glad you’re fine. I don’t know what I would do if something have happened to you.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Heh, no need to worry. You know I can take care of myself.” Lia smiled at the maid.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Yes, but..”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Sister, I’m back! Sorry to keep you waiting for so long.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  Lexie entered the carriage in the middle of their conversation.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “It’s about time sister. Did you visit the place you wanted to?”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Yes, I’m finished in the city for today. But are you sure you don’t want to go anywhere else today?”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  Exhausted Kaelia nodded. “I’m sure. I already have everything I needed. Let’s head home if you’re done.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Yes, I’m exhausted. And father should be home soon too” Lexie smiled at Lia and ordered the carriage to head back to the mansion.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  ‘Oh, I’m so exhausted sister. I hope you’ll like the gift I have prepared for you.’ Lia closed her eyes and smiled softly leaning of her hand supported by her knees.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  Carriage was moving towards the mansion, they entered the forest that surrounded mansion, passed the village in Stewart family land. And finally arrived at the mansion.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  Few hours before...
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  Duke Kane left the mansion for the royal palace. He arrived there after a while. When he got there a tall man with pitch black hair and deep blue eyes was waiting for Kane.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “You’re here Duke Kane, I hope your way here was comfortable.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Thank you advisor Alfred.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  It was kings advisor Alfred. With his sharp sight and tall stature standing there, meeting Kane.
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “I’ll show you to a room where you can take a rest before the first training starts.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  “Thank you advisor Alfred. I’m in your care now.”
  </div>

  <div class="line">
  And Alfred along with royal guards made their way with Kane to a resting place.
  </div>
